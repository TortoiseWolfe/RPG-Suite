# React in WordPress - Clarification

## The Truth About React in WordPress

1. **WordPress Core**: Does NOT include React globally
2. **Gutenberg/Block Editor**: DOES include React (wp.element)
3. **When React is Available**: Only when WordPress loads its editor scripts

## Our Options

### Option 1: Use WordPress Block Editor React (Current Approach)
- **Pros**: No duplicate React, follows WordPress patterns
- **Cons**: Only available on pages that load editor scripts
- **Fix**: We need to explicitly enqueue WordPress's React

### Option 2: Bundle Our Own React 
- **Pros**: Always available, predictable
- **Cons**: Duplicate React if block editor is loaded
- **Best for**: Standalone plugins that don't integrate with Gutenberg

### Option 3: Conditional Loading
- **Pros**: Use WordPress React if available, fallback to bundled
- **Cons**: Complex to manage
- **Best for**: Maximum compatibility

## Recommended Solution

For RPG-Suite, we should fix our current approach:

1. Explicitly load WordPress's React packages
2. Use wp-scripts but ensure React is available
3. Enqueue the proper WordPress script dependencies

## Code Fix Needed

```php
// Ensure React is loaded even outside editor
wp_enqueue_script('wp-element'); // WordPress's React
wp_enqueue_script('wp-components'); // WordPress's components
wp_enqueue_script('wp-api-fetch'); // WordPress's fetch wrapper
```

This ensures React is available on frontend pages, not just in the editor.
