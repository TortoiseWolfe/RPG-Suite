# Alternative: Bundled React Approach

Since WordPress doesn't include React globally by default, here's an alternative approach that's more reliable:

## Option A: Current Approach (WordPress Scripts)
- Uses WordPress's React when available
- Follows WordPress standards
- Requires explicit loading of wp-element

## Option B: Bundle React (More Reliable)

### 1. Update package.json
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "@wordpress/api-fetch": "^6.24.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.88.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.0",
    "@babel/core": "^7.22.0",
    "@babel/preset-env": "^7.22.0",
    "@babel/preset-react": "^7.22.0",
    "babel-loader": "^9.1.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. Use Standard Webpack
```javascript
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
    filename: 'rpg-suite-react.js'
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-react']
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### 3. Update PHP
```php
wp_enqueue_script(
    'rpg-suite-react',
    RPG_SUITE_PLUGIN_URL . 'build/rpg-suite-react.js',
    array(), // No WordPress dependencies
    RPG_SUITE_VERSION,
    true
);
```

## Pros of Bundling
1. Works everywhere, always
2. No dependency on WordPress packages
3. Predictable behavior
4. Simpler deployment

## Cons of Bundling
1. Larger file size
2. Might duplicate React if other plugins use it
3. Not the "WordPress way"

## Recommendation
For maximum reliability, especially given the issues you've been having, bundling React might be the better choice. It's more predictable and will work consistently across all WordPress installations.
