# RPG-Suite System Requirements

## Overview
RPG-Suite is a WordPress plugin designed to add role-playing game functionality to WordPress sites using BuddyPress. The system features dynamic React-based character sheets with real-time updates, multi-layer caching for performance, and a unique d7-based dice system set in a steampunk world with airballoons and zeppelins.

## Core Requirements

### User and Character Management
1. Users can create multiple characters (default limit: 2)
2. Only one character can be active at a time
3. Users can switch between their characters without page reloads
4. Character ownership is tied to WordPress user accounts
5. Real-time character updates across browser sessions

### Character Data
1. Characters are stored as custom post types (`rpg_character`) with proper capability mapping
2. Characters have d7-based attributes (Fortitude, Precision, Intellect, Charisma)
3. Skills use d7 die codes (e.g., "3d7+2") with visual dice rolling
4. Characters can create and manage inventions/gadgets
5. Active status is tracked in character metadata with real-time updates
6. Characters have ownership relationship with WordPress users
7. Revision tracking for conflict resolution in concurrent updates
8. Cache versioning for optimized performance

### d7 System
1. Attributes and skills use d7 dice codes
2. Digital dice rolling implementation with visual feedback
3. Invention mechanics for creating gadgets
4. Character classes representing different professions
5. Die roll history and statistics tracking

### BuddyPress Integration
1. Active character displays on user's BuddyPress profile with React components
2. Character information appears in profile header with real-time updates
3. Character switching interface is accessible from profile without page reloads
4. Compatible with BuddyX theme and modern CSS frameworks
5. Character inventions displayed on profile with interactive UI
6. React mount points integrated seamlessly with BuddyPress hooks

### Plugin Architecture
1. Hybrid architecture with PHP backend and React frontend
2. PSR-4 compliant autoloading for PHP classes
3. RESTful API for frontend-backend communication
4. Event-based communication between components
5. Global accessibility via `$rpg_suite` variable (PHP) and Context API (React)
6. Proper hook registration and priority handling
7. Die code utility with visual React components
8. Multi-layer caching strategy (Object cache, Transients, HTTP cache)
9. Docker support for React development environment
10. Build process for production deployment

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Requirements
1. PHP 7.4+ with WordPress 5.8+

2. Character switching < 500ms
3. API response time < 200ms for cached data
4. Support for 100+ concurrent users
5. Efficient caching with < 5% cache misses

## Security Requirements
1. Proper capability checks for all operations
2. Nonce verification for state-changing requests
3. SQL injection prevention
4. XSS protection for all user input
5. CORS configuration for API endpoints
6. Rate limiting for API requests

## API Requirements

### REST Endpoints
1. Character CRUD operations
2. User character listing
3. Character switching
4. Batch updates for performance
5. Field selection for optimized responses
6. Proper authentication and authorization
7. Consistent error handling
8. API versioning for backward compatibility

### Response Format

2. Consistent field naming
3. Proper HTTP status codes
4. Pagination support
5. Error response standards
6. Cache headers

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing
